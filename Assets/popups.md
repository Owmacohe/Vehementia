Let the anger consume you! Let its ichor flow through your veins! Subsume to rage, subsume to fury! Bring out the rancid fetters that dwell in your mindâ€™s dark corners! Submit! Submit!

## Sanctuary popups

***Prologue***
Let us speak now of hatred and suffering. The dark whisperings that spring forth in idle minds, and take hold. Send them back, howling from whence they came! Call forth your vehemence, and stain your soul. In time you will wash them all away to amnesia.

***When entering the sanctuary***
Breathe deep, small one. You are safe. You are warm. The beasts cannot harm you here. Sit, sleep, and let forgetfulness take you.

***When healing***
Wash the blood from your wounds, and the pain from your mind. Let your sins flow away to afterthought.

***When buying/equipping items***
My gift of sleep and your gift of death are not so different. Choose wisely, and bring swift justice to those horrid beasts.

***When exiting the sanctuary***
Be well, small one. Dark horrors await you beyond my reach. As always, I will await your end.
