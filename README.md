# Vehementia

*Third game prototype for my CART 315 class. Make sure to open the **Prologue** scene first.*

## Game features

- Heavy focus on balancing narrative and combat
- “Feel-good” combat, with satisfying responsiveness
- Integration of voice lines and accompanying animated text
- Replayability, with moments of reprieve for proper pacing

## Journal

### Design hypothesis
- Is it possible to make an (at least mildly) ethical ultra-violent game?
- How can we use calm and/or proper narratives to counteract this?
- Use of gameplay “momentum” to sway player emotion

***Entry 5***

## Questions for playtesters

1. Is the game too jarring when transitioning between the “calm” and “violent” sections?
1. Does the music transition well?
1. How does the combat feel? Rewarding? Impactful?
1. Is the game too difficult? (also curious what high score playtesters were able to get)
1. Are the sound effects (e.g. monster sounds, voice lines) integrated well?
1. Should the game have more narrative? Less?
